# DB Context Experiments

## Information

```
This is just an experiment I am running in .Net Core to better understand the DB Context.
I have always built Unit of Work and DB on top of one another and splitting them after the build
has become a real issue. I want to build one and just have that do everything.
```

## Install Notes

```
I wouldn't waste your time - This is not suppose to do anything major.
Unless you want to play around with how to work with Databases better.
```

## Questions or Commits

```
I am always up for better ways of writing code, and I really want to understand this.
If you check it out and see something I can improve, or you can't point me in better direction
please do.
